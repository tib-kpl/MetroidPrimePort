/**
 * On-screen controller drawn over the game surface.
 *
 * It feeds an SDL virtual gamepad rather than synthesising keyboard keys, so the
 * game's own controller mapping, prompts and rebinding treat it as a real pad,
 * and its sticks are sticks rather than four keys pretending to be one.
 *
 * Three layouts (the F1 "Layout" setting). Default: the GameCube pad's, with no
 * C-stick; a drag on the free screen area aims like a mouse. Classic GameCube
 * brings back the C-stick and the D-pad. Twin stick (Remastered) has a right
 * stick that aims directly and Remastered's Dual Sticks button labels. The game
 * assigns the actions.
