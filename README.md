# Metroid Prime — native port

A native build of **Metroid Prime** for Linux, Windows and Android, compiled
from the [PrimeDecomp](https://github.com/PrimeDecomp/prime) decompilation and
rendered through Aurora (SDL3/WebGPU). There's no emulator involved. Supported
discs: USA 1.00, 1.01 and 1.02, and PAL.

**No game content is included.** You need your own copy of the game: the port
reads it from a disc image and never ships any of its assets. This repository
ships no disc image, and neither does any package or release built from it.

> **Ce dépôt est un fork** de [Odrannnn/MetroidPrimePort](https://github.com/Odrannnn/MetroidPrimePort)
> dont le but est la prise en charge des langues, **en priorité le français**,
> avec le disque européen (*Metroid Prime (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)*), dont les
> textes existent en français, allemand, espagnol et italien. Au premier
> lancement le jeu prend la langue du système ; le menu F1 (Language) la change.
> Chaque push publie une release (onglet *Releases*) : APK Android signé, zip
> Windows, AppImage et archive Linux, qui acceptent le disque américain comme le
> disque européen.

> *This repository is a fork focused on language support, French first.*

## Downloads

Releases are published on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Odrannnn/MetroidPrimePort/releases).
Every build needs your own disc image; none of them contains one.

## Building

Needs CMake 3.25+, Ninja and a C++20 toolchain. Aurora and MusyX are vendored, so
a normal clone is enough; Aurora fetches its pinned dependencies on the first
configure.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/native -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DAURORA_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF -DMP_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build/native -j 4
ctest --test-dir build/native -L port --output-on-failure
```

On Windows, run from an MSVC developer shell and add
`-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl`. CI builds and tests
Linux (GCC 14 and Clang 18) and Windows (clang-cl); see
`.github/workflows/`.

### Android

```sh
tools/make_android_keystore.sh          # once; writes android/keystore.properties
tools/android_apk.sh :app:assembleRelease
```

## Running

```sh
./build/native/metroid_prime_port "/path/to/Metroid Prime (USA) (v1.00).iso"
```

## Packaging

`tools/make_appimage.sh` builds a self-contained AppImage and
`tools/make_flatpak.sh` a Flatpak. Neither bundles the disc. See
`docs/NATIVE_PORT.md` for what each one expects from the host.

## Credits and licensing

This is a fork of the [PrimeDecomp/prime](https://github.com/PrimeDecomp/prime)
decompilation, which the game logic is built from. Aurora (`extern/aurora`) and
MusyX (`extern/musyx`) are MIT-licensed vendored snapshots, and the button
prompt icons come from Kenney's Input Prompts pack (CC0), vendored under
`tools/prompt_icons`. Their licences are kept alongside them and are copied into
release packages.

`LICENSE` covers this project's own work — the platform layer, the build and
packaging scripts, and the Android and Flatpak integration. It does **not** cover
the game code under `src/` and `include/`, which comes from the decompilation
and remains Nintendo's. See `NOTICE`.

Metroid Prime is a trademark of Nintendo. This project is unaffiliated with
Nintendo and Retro Studios, and ships no game data.

`docs/NATIVE_PORT.md` is the detailed reference: build options, the smoke-test hooks,
and the platform notes. Every setting and environment variable lives in
`docs/SETTINGS.md` (debug console: `docs/CONSOLE.md`, mods: `docs/MODS.md`).

Parts of this port were written with AI coding assistants, under my oversight.
