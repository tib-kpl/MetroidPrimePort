# texture replacements, with a launcher and icon. The disc image is not
# included (it is the user's own), so the port asks for it on first launch and
# remembers the answer.
#
# Usage: tools/make_appimage.sh [build-dir] [output-dir]
#
# appimagetool is fetched into the output directory on first use; it needs
# network access to pull the AppImage runtime unless --runtime-file is used.
